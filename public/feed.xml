      <description><![CDATA[The history of Cebu goes way beyond 439 years ago when the island became a province at the start of the Spanish colonization.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[---
# The Rich History of Cebu

The history of Cebu stretches back much further than 439 years ago, predating its official provincial status under Spanish colonization. Long before the Spanish arrival, Cebu was a bustling **center of trade** in what is now the southern Philippines, engaging with merchants from China, Malaysia, Japan, India, Burma, and other parts of Asia.

## Pre-Colonial Society

Before the Spaniards, Cebu boasted an organized social structure. Communities were small, typically ranging from **30 to 100 households**, grouped into units called **barangays**, largely based on kinship. Each barangay was headed by a **datu**, who served as the leader. The datu's role was multifaceted: they governed the community, settled disputes, made crucial decisions, protected their village from enemies, led them into battle, and received labor and tributes from their people. This position was both a political office and a social class, with authority derived from lineage. However, a datu's actual power depended on their wealth, the number of subjects, and their reputation for physical prowess.

Within these communities, there were also **free men called timawa** and the **olipon**. Spanish reports characterized the olipon as dependents rather than slaves, noting the absence of the violence and harshness common in European slavery.

The people of Cebu at this time were known as **pintados** due to the extensive tattooing on the men. **Lavish gold jewelry** was common, worn by both women and men as ornaments. Permanent, **townhouse-looking wooden structures** were where the datus resided, while ordinary people lived in **field cottages or *balay-balay***, which were built on stilts. Common features included a *hagdan* (house ladder), *salog* (floors) made of bamboo or wood, and an *atop* (roof) made of palm tree shingles.

## Spanish Arrival and Transformation

In **1521**, Ferdinand Magellan and his troops arrived in Cebu and were initially **warmly welcomed by Rajah Humabon's community**, who subsequently converted to Christianity. However, Magellan met a different reception on the island of Mactan, where he was **slain by the local chieftain, Lapulapu**. Cebu remained free until Manuel Lopez de Legazpi arrived in **1566**.

This marked the beginning of Cebu's transformation under Spanish rule. **Catholic churches were built**, and priests governed communities alongside civil leaders. **Watchtowers were scattered along the island** to guard against Moro raids. Economically and culturally, **fiesta celebrations were embraced**, and **new agricultural products were introduced**. Royal decrees spurred commercial and agricultural expansion, leading to the **establishment of elementary schools in every municipality**.

## Challenges and Revolutions

Between **1872 and 1896**, widespread propaganda against Spanish abuses emerged. A **sugar crisis** brought an end to the agricultural prosperity Cebu province had enjoyed, forcing sugar barons or *hacienderos* to declare bankruptcy in **1892**.

The **Philippine Revolution** against Spain began in **1898**. However, before full independence could be realized, American troops arrived, and **United States sovereignty over the Philippines was declared**. The Filipino-American War broke out on **February 7, 1900**.

The subsequent history of Cebu became intertwined with national and global events, including **World War II, the Japanese occupation, postwar reconstruction, Philippine independence, and the declaration of Martial Law**, among others.

## The Enduring Spirit of Cebuanos

Throughout all these historical events, the **valiant spirit of the Cebuanos** has remained evident. They are characterized by their principles and resilience, their dedication to hard work, and their high standards of morality and professionalism, qualities that have consistently made Cebu stand out.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The history of the Philippines dates from the earliest hominin activity in the archipelago at least by 709,000 years ago.[1] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon[2][3] at least by 134,000 years ago.[4]

The earliest known anatomically modern human was from Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[5] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines.[6] These were followed by Austroasiatics, Papuans, and South Asians.[7] By around 3000 BCE, seafaring Austronesians, who form the majority of the current population, migrated southward from Taiwan.[8] By 2000 BCE the archipelago was the crux of a trans-oceanic Philippine jade culture.[9]

Scholars generally believe that these ethnic and social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization.[10] Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.[11] This includes the predecessors of modern-day population centers such as Manila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, Zamboanga and Sulu[12] as well as some polities, such as Ma-i, whose possible location is either Mindoro or Laguna.[13]

These polities were influenced by Islamic, Indian, and Chinese cultures. Islam arrived from Arabia, while Indian Hindu-Buddhist[14] religion, language, culture, literature and philosophy arrived from the Indian subcontinent .[15] Some polities were Sinified tributary states allied to China. These small maritime states flourished from the 1st millennium.[16][17]

These kingdoms traded with what are now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The remainder of the settlements were independent barangays allied with one of the larger states. These small states alternated from being part of or being influenced by larger Asian empires like the Ming dynasty, Majapahit and Brunei or rebelling and waging war against them.[18]

The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition, which landed in Homonhon Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar, on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed.[19][20][21] The Spanish Philippines began with the Pacific expansion of New Spain and the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu.[22]

Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines. Spanish colonial rule saw the introduction of Christianity, the code of law, and the oldest modern university in Asia. The Philippines was ruled under the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain. After this, the colony was directly governed by Spain, following Mexico's independence.

Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act.[23] The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.]]></content:encoded>
